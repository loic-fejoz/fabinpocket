FabInPocket - Tools in your pocket to design 3D models to make in a FabLab
===============================================================================

Description
-----------

[FabInPocket](https://github.com/loic-fejoz/fabinpocket) is a simple online tool to design 3D models on your smartphone or tablet for 3D printing or milling.

The main idea is for a newcomer in a FabLab to be able to 3D print or mill its own model on the first day.

As of 11th July 2015, it is only possible to import existing image, and then export as STL or PNG heightmap.

System Requirements
----------------------

As of 11th July 2015, FabInPocket requiers:

- a browser with WebGL enable

Installation
